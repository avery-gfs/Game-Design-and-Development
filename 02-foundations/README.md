- Object basics: creation, access
- Conditionals: `if`, `else if`, `else`, nested
- Loops: `for`, `while`
- Custom functions
- Variable scope
- Logging

## Game Behaviors

## Problems

Make a game with two sprites that each move in 2 dimensions. One sprite is controlled with the arrows keys, the other with WASD. Make both sprites loop to the other side if they go off the board.

Make a game with a sprite that falls under the force of gravity and stops at the bottom of the screen. Make the up arrow jump the sprite.

Make a sprite that follows the mouse with "elastic" motion.

Make an AI character that chases the player sprite in two dimensions.

Make a player that moves laterally and catches falling objects, with a counter.

Make a projectile simulator.

Make a planetary system gravity simulator.

Make a particle simulation of balls bouncing off the walls and each other.

Make "asteroids".
