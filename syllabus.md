# Syllabus: Game Design and Development

## Class Topics, Format, and Philosophy

In this class, we will explore game programming and design in its many forms.
We'll start by creating 2D games using Javascript, and learn about core game
programming concepts like user input, movement, physics, game AI, asset design,
and game logic. This will probably take us through the first 3 months or so of
the class. After that, we'll do a couple quick units on multiplayer games and
text-based games. Finally, we'll spend the rest of the class exploring 3D game
programming using Unity and C#.

While we'll be doing a lot of programming in this class, programming knowledge
is not a prerequisite; we'll be learning the coding concepts you need to know as
we go along. Making games is a great way to learn programming, since it covers
many topics (like logic, user interaction, and graphics), and provides a
concrete, visual way to see your code in action!

The specific material we cover is somewhat flexible. If there are other topics
that you're interested in learning about, let me know and I'll try to
incorporate them into the curriculum.

Our work in this class will be centered around a series of projects that each
cover a new topic, with a structure that looks something like this:

1. Introduce a new topic
2. Technical details and demonstration
3. Project work in class
4. Out of class work (optional)
5. Release solutions
6. Review and discuss solutions

I think that the best way to learn software engineering is by reading and
writing software, so we'll be doing a lot of that!

## Grading and Workload

Grading for this class is pass/fail. You don't have to master all the material;
as long as you participate in class and do the work, you'll pass. I'll give
occasional quizzes as a tool to get feedback on my teaching, but your classwork
and participation are what's important.

I know that you all have a lot on your plates, so I don't plan on assigning
homework as long as our time in class is focused and productive. However, I will
provide lots of optional problems and projects that you can work on outside of
class if you want to explore the material on a deeper level.

## AI Tools

Generative AI tools can be a great asset when learning a new language and
debugging code, but they're only one of many resources. As a software engineer,
it's vital that you learn to utilize a wide set of tools when you encounter
challenges, including:

- Official documentation
- Software Q&A sites
- Issue trackers and discussions
- Books and tutorials
- Reading source code
- Your teacher and your fellow classmates!

With this in mind, I ask that you not use AI tools for our in-class work. When
doing work outside of class-time, you may use AI tools to get feedback on the
code you write, but not to write code for you.

Do this:

> I wrote this function (your code here) to check if a number is prime, but it
> runs forever without returning a result. What am I doing wrong?

Don't do this:

> Write a function that checks if a number is prime.

You may not use Github Copilot, Replit AI, or other "code autocomplete" AI tools
when doing work for this class.

## Feedback

I'll try to provide feedback on the code you write for this class. Writing code
that works is only the first step of software engineering; the next step is
figuring out how to make your code modern, simple, and efficient. My hope is
that getting feedback will help you level-up this important aspect of your
programming skills.
